    "Notes:\n",
    "- Paper title, author names, year, and journal are present in the Covidence exported .csv. As such, I am only extracting paper title from the table of contents so I can match the details against the covidence csv. However, note that some paper titles are not extracted properly, so these will need to be matched based on the file name at a later point (which does get extracted with this script)\n",
    "- Recorder device: extracted from METHODS ONLY, uses keywords (see keyword list above), outputs all sentences with keywords into a spreadsheet that will then need to be manually reviewed. If a paper does not seem to have any rec device sentences extracted, we'll have to manually go in.\n",
    "- Segmentation software: extracted from METHODS ONLY, uses keywords (see keyword list above), outputs all sentences with keywords into a spreadsheet that will then need to be manually reviewed. Note that we'll have to manually identify items that constitute 'Other' and if the 'speech processing algorithm' text is not part of methods, we'll also have to\n",
    "manually complement that item. As in, if there is a custom algorithm written (but it is not explicitly mentioned as a speech detection algorithm(s)) or a less common but named algo is used, this code will not capture that. However, I am fairly confident that this should only be a few cases (see Laudanska et al's results). Similarly, if a paper does not seem to have any software sentences extracted, we'll have to manually go in.\n",
    "- Manual annotation: extracted from METHODS ONLY, uses keywords (see keyword list above), outputs all sentences with keywords into a spreadsheet that will then need to be manually reviewed. My hunch is that if no manual annotation text is extracted, it was not done? \n",
    "- Languages and countries (and US states): extracted from METHODS ONLY, uses specific python libraries (GeoText and pycountry), and are simply extracted from Methods and added to a spreadsheet. The extraction is more dynamics than the others, because I use the country lists extracted for each paper (+ a list of US states) to then extract sentences with mentions of the countries or US states.\n",
    "    - Countries (and US states): I do also extract sentences containing countries and sentences containing the names of US states (because some US studies only mention the US state re: location) for further manual verification. Also note that some papers may mention US vs. United States, and this gets extracted as United States using the country code, but the list  \n",
    "    - Languages: flagging is case sensitive as it is set up. While I do not think this is an issue for more common languages, there are also languages such as 'As' and 'To', and if the matcher is case insensitive, 'as' and 'to' will be matched, and we don't want that. At any rate, some of the languages in the language list will need to be manually deleted (see point about 'As' and 'to', for instance). Also note that because some of these more common words are extracted as languages, I have chosen not to extract sentences with language references.\n",
    "    - It might be useful to determine if we want to just go with the extracted list or go in and check for languages/countries/states for cases where there is no extracted language or country list for a paper.  \n",
    "- Mentions of ACLEW etc: extracted from ALL text except refs, keyword match-based extraction without further manual verification. Since these are very specific keywords, my hunch is that this should be sufficient. There are some papers (such as some PNAS) papers that do not have a titled Refernce section are extracted using the entire text (but these are very few). This is simply a YES or NO spreadsheet and is not set up for further manual review\n",
    "- Topics are extracted from Methods and Results combined. This is also a YES or NO spreadsheet and is not set up for further manual review\n",
    "- Methods and Results text are extracted by identifying the start of the Methods Section and a reasonable guess of the next section (see code block where these regexp patterns are defined; MethodsStartPattern, etc) and similarly for the Results section\n",
    "    - However, if methods and results sections cannot be reliably identified, extraction is attempted using pymupdf's table of contents by identifying text that has Methods (or other variants). If this also fails, that paper is not extracted, and will need to be manually extracted. Community/consortia details are extracted from every paper (unless it is not read in by pymupdf4llm)\n",
    "- Extraction from tables might be a hit or a miss, so there's a degree of error here, if some of this info is in a table. That broadly does not seem to be the case, however.\n",
    "But, it might be worth it to quickly manually look for tables in the main text, if we choose to do so (I think it might be ok to miss anything that's relegated to the SI)\n",
    "- Paper title is extracted both from the table of contents (PaperTitle_ToC) and separately by pulling all of the largest text in the first page (PaperTitle_NoToC) \n"
